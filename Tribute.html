        Nikola Tesla, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]â€”died January 7, 1943, New York,
        New York,
        U.S.), Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented the rotating magnetic field, the basis
        of most
        alternating-current machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission. He
        immigrated to
        the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers,
        and
        motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio
        technology.

        Tesla was from a family of Serbian origin. His father was an Orthodox priest; his mother was unschooled but
        highly
        intelligent. As he matured, he displayed remarkable imagination and creativity as well as a poetic touch.
